Installation
------------

The easy way to install this web forum software is to unpack all files from the
archive and then go to the URL where you uploaded the files to in your browser.
You will be pointed to install.php where you can select an installation method.
A new installation is probably what you want to do but importing from other
forum systems is also possible, you need to copy the import script in then.

For a more detailed installation guide or in case problems occur, please head
over to the online documentation:
