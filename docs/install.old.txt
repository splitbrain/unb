IMPORTANT NOTE:  A more current and detailed installation guide can be found
                 on the UNB homepage in the online documentation at
                 http://newsboard.unclassified.de/docs.php#admin_install

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to install this Unclassified NewsBoard release:

1. Unpack the distributed archive file into a directory on your webserver. The
   only limitation for the files is they need to be chmod 0666 in some cases,
   namely when the files are owned by another user than the PHP process. You
   can use docs/test/test.php to retrieve all necessary information about your
   server environment.

   Please DO NOT upload the docs/ directory on your webspace. You won't need
   it anyway and it may be unsafe to do so in some cases.

2. Make sure you hold a MySQL database account where you are allowed to create
   tables and access to their data. You will need the following information to
   connect to the database:
   - Server name: IP address or hostname
   - User and password
   - Database name

3. You are now ready to run the automatic installation script. Its URL is the
   hostname and path that you copied the files into, followed by "install.php",
   i.e.: http://localhost/forum/install.php

   This script will first ask you some questions about the forum's title and
   your database account information and then create all necessary tables in
   the database and create some first initialisation records.

   If you want to upgrade from an older UNB version (from 1.4.x on), select
   the "Update" option. This will perform all modifications to your database
   layout and keep all users, forums, posts etc.

4. As the install script will tell you now, you still need to adjust some of
   the board settings, like the e-mail account to be used or display options.
   Just follow the link to the control panel. You should also update your
   profile and change your username and password there.

5. You can now create all forums you wish to offer to your users and set all
   access rights accordingly.

6. When you're finished with all this, unlock the board by unchecking the
   "Administrative board lock" option in the "Advanced Configuration".

You can do some configuration after this time, i.e. changing designs by
updating the according CSS files and designs.cfg.php, or change some special
user rights by assigning a user to additional groups and/or edit the rules in
the ACL editor. But remember a validated user MUST be member of the "Users"
group!

To get some more information on how to use this software, see the help page or
the documentation on the project website. And don't forget to check the website
for further updates of this board!

Have a lot of fun...
